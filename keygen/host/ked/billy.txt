Billy Elliot - Finale Lyrics

It does'nt matter if your large or small,
trapezeoid or short or tall,
even if you can't dance at all,
all you really have to do is shine.

It does'nt matter if your lifes a mess,
the whole process will coalesce,
just try to evervesce,
all you realy have to do is shine.

Everyone is different,
its a natural thing,
its a fact,
its plain to see,

The world is grey enough,
without making it worse,
we need individuality.

'Cos what the hell is wrong,
with expressing yourself,
what we need in-di-vid-u-a-li-ty
